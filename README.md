Right off the bat I want to state that the The FtpClient.cs and SingleInstanceMutex.cs files aren't my own creation so I'm not taking any credit for them. I may have taken some inspiration of some snipets of code over Internet that I don't recall from where I got them right now, so take this as is.

Anyway.. this is an old project intended for personal use that I created sometimes back in like 2019 in Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition that I did mostly for my pure enjoyment with it's UI in Romanian language. It's purpose was to 'sit' in system tray with an icon for the user to see and based on a cron schedule (via CronTasks library) or at user's will to download two CVS files (named Descarcare.log and Incarcare.log that can be found in the 'extra' folder) from a PLC (a TM221 series equipment from Schneider Electric if memory serves me right) that's was keeping track of some data from an industrial machine (a mill for a pigs farm with 6 secret mixed recepies that I don't know so don't ask) via FTP (via FtpClient.cs that is NOT my own creation and I'm not taking credit for it, I found it online at the time as an alternative to the 'WebClient' way). The two files are cleaned and turned into proper valid CVS code and then imported into a sqlite3 database only if aren't already in there. The app was intended for a user to either view the imported data in my fancy app (thanks to MetroModernUI library) or export said data based on filters (a period of time for example) the user would apply into an Excel file (via NPOI library directly, this was before switching to Npoi.Mapper as I did in one project or ExcelMapper as I did in later in other personal use small projects) for user to do whatever pleases with that information.
